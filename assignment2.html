                <h3>LED Resistor</h3>
                <p>
                I chose 220Ω for the resistors for my LEDs because I needed to find the optimal resistor to prevent broken LEDs. The reasoning is -- two(yellow, green) have 1.8 V drop. Current is 20 mA. Voltage from Arduino is 5V. Using Ohm’s law(V = I x R), the circulation to find R is:5V - 1.8V = 3.2 V = 0.02 (20mA) x R. R is 160Ω. And the resistors nearest value to 160Ω were 220Ω.
               
                <h3>Push Button Resistor</h3>
                <p>
                To prevent that current goes too high going into the ground pin, which would break the Arduino, the circuit needs a resistor for a push button. The maximum current allowed to go into the ground pin is 200mA. As current voltage is 5V, it needs at least 25 ohms of resistance. So I chose 100ohms for the push button resistor, which has nearest value to 25 ohms.

                Tada! Once clicked the push button, the yellow LED blinks for 0.5 seconds. Then, the green LED fades in and out smoothly.
